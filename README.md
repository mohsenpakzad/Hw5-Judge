### Generate test case ###

In this choice you can generate main code outputs.

At first you have to enter the path of the inputs folder. There are 3 ways:

    1-Drag and drop the folder into the .exe window

If the path was correct, it will ask you to confirm the inputs.

Then you have to enter the path of the C-main-file. The ways are the same.


Notes: 

   If there were any mistakes in entering the paths, you will know it.
    
   The maximum number of test cases is 500.


### Judge ###


Note: You have to generate test cases at first, to access this option.

In this choice you can generate user code outputs and check for results.

Enter the path of C-user-file as same as you did at first step.


## Features
